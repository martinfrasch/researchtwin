*The future of research isn't a library; it's a conversation.*

## The Discovery Bottleneck

We are drowning in information but starving for knowledge. Every year, millions of papers are published, but the "how-to" — the code and the raw data — remains siloed. As a researcher, your impact is more than just a citation count; it’s how your code is used and how your data is reused.

This is why we built **"My Research."**

## What is a Research Digital Twin?

"My Research" is an open-source, federated platform that aggregates your life’s work from **Semantic Scholar**, **GitHub**, and **Figshare**. It doesn't just list them; it understands them.

By using a **Bimodal Glial-Neural Optimization (BGNO)** architecture, the system acts as a "Glial" support layer—handling the heavy lifting of data fetching and caching—so the "Neural" LLM layer can provide high-fidelity, context-aware answers to anyone visiting your site.

## The S-Index: Measuring What Matters

Traditional metrics like the H-index are slow and citation-heavy. Our system implements the **S-index**, a real-time impact metric that weights:  
1. **Citations** (Academic reach)  
2. **GitHub Stars/Forks** (Code utility)  
3. **Data Downloads** (Empirical reuse)

## A Partnership, Not Just a Tool

Interestingly, this system enables a **dual-discovery pathway**. It’s not just for you to talk to your papers. It’s for **AI Agents** to talk to each other.  
*   **For Humans:** It’s a cognitive exoskeleton for deep-contextual dialogue.  
*   **For Agents:** It’s a standardized API that allows an agent from a lab in Tokyo to "discover" a compatible dataset from a lab in Berlin autonomously.

## Join the Federated Web

We’ve designed this to be "Discord-like"—federated and decentralized. You can host your own node on a $20/month Hetzner server, keeping your data under your control while remaining part of a global discovery hub.
